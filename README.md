# HealthImageHub: Streamlining Hospital Image Management with Cloud Technology

## Project Overview

HealthImageHub is a web-based platform designed to simplify image management for hospital administrators. This project leverages Bootstrap and ReactJS to provide a user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to easily upload, classify, and manage medical images. With the integration of Firebase Storage and Firestore Database, HealthImageHub ensures secure storage and efficient management of image data and classification results.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for hospital administrators to access the platform.
- **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload medical images securely and efficiently.
- **Automatic Image Classification**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to classify uploaded images and provide immediate results.
- **Data Management**: Stores images in Firebase Storage and image metadata, including URLs, classification results, and other relevant information in Firebase Firestore Database.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Designed with Bootstrap and ReactJS for ease of use by non-technical users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Firebase account for accessing Firebase Storage and Firestore Database services

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HealthImageHub.git
   cd HealthImageHub
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

   - Create a Firebase project in your Firebase console.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication, Firebase Storage, and Firestore Database.
   - Add your Firebase project configuration to a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Example configuration:

     ```
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:your_app_id:web:your_app_code
     ```

4. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

Once logged in, users can upload images through the interface. The system automatically classifies the images and saves the results alongside the image data in Firestore Database. Users can view and manage all uploaded images and their associated data through the platform.
